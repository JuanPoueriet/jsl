    "POST_1_EXCERPT": "Angular 17+ has redefined Server-Side Rendering. We analyze the changes in hydration and how it's beating other frameworks in performance.",
    "POST_1_CONTENT": "<p>Angular has come a long way. With the introduction of non-destructive hydration in Angular 17, Server-Side Rendering (SSR) performance has taken a quantum leap. In this article, we break down what this means for developers and why JSL Technology is betting heavily on this tech for our clients.</p><p>Hydration is the process of 'waking up' a server-rendered application on the client-side. Historically, Angular would 'wipe' and re-render the DOM, a costly process. Now, it 'walks' the existing DOM and simply attaches event listeners, resulting in an incredibly fast Time to Interactive (TTI).</p><h3>Key Benefits</h3><ul><li><strong>Better FCP and LCP:</strong> Google's Core Web Vitals love this.</li><li><strong>Improved SEO:</strong> Crawlers get full content instantly.</li><li><strong>Seamless User Experience:</strong> No more 'blinking' or 'flashing' on load.</li></ul>",

    "POST_2_EXCERPT": "Many people use UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) interchangeably. This is a costly mistake. We explain the crucial difference.",
    "POST_2_CONTENT": "<p>In the world of software development, two terms constantly buzz around: UI and UX. They are often grouped together, but they are not the same. Confusing them can lead to products that look beautiful but are useless, or are functional but frustrating.</p><h3>What is UI (User Interface)?</h3><p>UI is the 'look and feel'. It's the visual part. It's about the buttons, the colors, the typography, and the layout. Good UI design is attractive, consistent, and aesthetic. It's the 'canvas' and the 'paint'.</p><h3>What is UX (User Experience)?</h3><p>UX is the 'feel' and 'efficiency'. It's the design process that ensures a product is logical, easy to use, and solves a real problem. It's the 'architecture' and 'engineering' behind the paint. At JSL, our 'Discovery & Strategy' process focuses heavily on UX before a single line of code is written.</p>",

    "POST_3_CONTENT": "<p>At JSL Technology, we don't just build apps; we build systems that grow. Cloud architecture is the foundation of any successful modern digital product. Here are the 5 principles we apply:</p><ol><li><strong>Design for Failure:</strong> Components will fail. Your system must be resilient and recover automatically.</li><li><strong>Decouple Everything:</strong> Use microservices, message queues (like SQS or RabbitMQ), and APIs. One component should not bring down another.</li><li><strong>Go Horizontal (Scale-Out):</strong> Don't make your server 'bigger' (Vertical); make more 'small' servers (Horizontal). Use load balancers and auto-scaling.</li><li><strong>Store State Externally:</strong> Your application instances should be 'stateless'. Store sessions, caches, and files in external services (like Redis, S3).</li><li><strong>Automation:</strong> From deployment (CI/CD) to scaling. Manual intervention is the enemy of scalability.</li></ol>"
